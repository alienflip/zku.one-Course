## Build üë∑

The repo has been setup with the proving and verifier keys generated from tornado cash's trusted setup ceremony.

1. Install the necessary packages with `npm i`
2. Build the artifacts with `truffle compile`

#### Build your own proving and verifying keys

If one desires, they can run these commands to build the circuit and get tests to work with their own keys:

1. `npm run build:circuit`
2. `cp build/circuits/Verifier.sol contracts/Verifier.sol`
3. `truffle compile`
  - follow the compiler on upgrade Verifier.sol to solidity 0.7.6:
    - pragma solidity 0.5.0 => 0.7.6
    - Find and replace "sub(gas" with "sub(gas()"
    - Find and replace "@return" with "return"

#### Verify the build:

1. `cd scripts`
2. `node verifySnark.js`

If the script returns 'true', the proof generation and verification is successful!

#### Generate typescript types for your contracts

1. `npm run build:types`

## Configuration üõ†Ô∏è

Our scripts and tests require the configuration of a `.env` file for operation. This also allows for quick changes of networks between ganache and harmony, or any other evm. An example `.env.example` file exists in this repo for reference.

## Interact with the Contracts 

Some scripts have been provided in the `scripts/` directory to interact with mixer contracts.
To use these scripts, `cd scripts` and run `node <script> <...args>`. 

A few that scripts you might find useful are below:
- `deployNativeAnchor.js (<hasher address> <verifier address>)`: This script will deploy a new mixer. The user may optionally provide the command-line arguments of addresses for the hasher and verifier, so as to not waste gas on redeployments. Simply modify the denomination to easily create mixers of different sizes.

- `depositNativeAnchor.js <anchor address>`: This script will make a deposit to the mixer at the passed in address and return the secret note used to withdraw. 

- `withdrawNativeAnchor.js <anchor address> <secret note> <recipient>`: This script will withdraw from the mixer at the address given the secret note and recipient.
