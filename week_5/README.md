## Shielding the TX

1. You have been asked to present a mechanism that will allow a user to privately and securely bridge 100,000 UST tokens from Ethereum to Harmony. Draft a write-up explaining the protocol to be built to cater for this need, highlighting the challenges to be faced and potential resolution to them.

```
```

2. In February 2022, a hack on a popular crypto bridge led to the second biggest crypto heist where $320m was lost. Following the technical details behind the hack, it is very clear that bridge smart contracts need to be airtight to prevent scrupulous individuals from taking advantage of them. Briefly explain key mechanisms you will put in place in your interoperable private bridge (specifically the withdrawal methods) to prevent a similar attack (Double withdrawal and fake withdrawal).

## Aztec

1. Briefly explain the concept of AZTEC Note and how the notes are used to privately represent various assets on a blockchain. There are various proofs utilized by the AZTEC protocol including range proofs, swap proofs, dividend proofs and join-split proofs. Highlight the features of these proofs and the roles they play in creating confidential transactions on the blockchain

## Webb

1. What is the difference between commitments made to the mixer, Anchor and VAnchor contracts? Can you think of a new commitment structure that could allow for a new feature? (eg: depositing one token and withdrawing another?) if so, what would the commitment look like?

```
```

2. Describe how the UTXO scheme works on the VAnchor contract.

```

## Thinking In ZK

1. If you have a chance to meet with the people who built the above protocols what questions would you ask them?
