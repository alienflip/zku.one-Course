1. How does InterRep use Semaphore in their implementation? Explain why InterRep still needs a centralized server.

```
```

2. Clone the InterRep repos: contracts and reputation-service. Follow the instructions on the Github repos to start the development environment. Try to join one of the groups, and then leave the group. Explain what happens to the Merkle Tree in the MongoDB instance when you decide to leave a group.

```
```

3. Use the public API (instead of calling the Kovan testnet, call your localhost) to query the status of your own identityCommitment in any of the social groups supported by InterRep before and after you leave the group. Take the screenshots of the responses and paste them to your assignment submission PDF.

```
```

4. [Bonus] Suggest a viable solution to make InterRep completely decentralized.

```
```
