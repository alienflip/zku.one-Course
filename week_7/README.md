1. Celestia is set out to be the consensus and data availability layer for blockchains. Chains built on top of Celestia can concentrate on execution. Do you think data availability is the true bottleneck to scale blockchain? Argue for and against the need for the data availability layer for blockchain.

2. Another popular zero knowledge technology in the market today is zk-STARKs. Starkware uses this technology to power dApps such as DiversiFi, ImmutableX, dYdX, etc.. List some advantages of zk-Starks over zk-Snarks. In your opinion, which one is better and why?

```
```

3. Write in brief ( 1- 2 line for each) about the polygonâ€™s product stack. Refer this Polygons ZK Product Overview

```

```

4. Write in brief (at least 4 -5 lines) about your learnings throughout the course.

```
1. before the course, I had a cursory understanding of why a zkp is useful. It is now significantly better. 
What is also nice is that I know where the gaps in my knowledge are with zkps. 
This is potentially even more valuable that what I learned during the course. 
```

5. Please provide an update on what you have achieved on your final project and what you plan on doing next.

[Final Project](https://github.com/alienflip/degenDeploy)

```
So milestone 1 is done: launching on harmony testnet with a feature complete product. 
Milestone 2 will be skipped, as this app has no need for a DAO (although I will make another proposal soon for a product with such a need!), so next on the list is main-net lauch. 
The DoD for this is simple: attempt to use the tool on an existing mixer, and prove it works (which, in fact, is ironic, since proof it works breaks the tool!).
