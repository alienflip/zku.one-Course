### Understanding and generating ideas about ZK tech

1. The main difference between snarks and starks is the requirement for a trusted setup-of which there is none in starks. Furthermore, the main circuit languages are different: snarks->circom, starks->cairo. starks are quantum secure.
2. Not sure! Hard to find information on this.
3. The main thing here is identity. We can use NFTs as identiy cards, and use zkp to hide identity data.
4. We use the above idea, and then allow people to communicate in DAOs without doxxing their identity.
