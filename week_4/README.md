## Which stream?

0. I will choose stream B.

## Scaling the future

1. Based on the above, a number of solutions have been proposed to solve this trilemma. Briefly describe the different scalability solutions and write pros and cons of each approach. What was the biggest problem with the Plasma approach?

```
```

2. One of the solutions that has been gaining a lot of traction lately is zkRollups. With the use of a diagram explain the key features of zkRollups. Argue for or against this solution highlighting its benefits or shortcomings with respect to other solutions proposed or in use.

```
```

3. Ethereum is a state machine that moves forward with each new block. At any instance, it provides a complete state of Ethereum consisting of the data related to all accounts and smart contracts running on the EVM. The state of Ethereum modifies whenever a transaction is added to the block by changing the balances of accounts. Based on the massive adoption of Ethereum across the globe, this state has become a bottleneck for validators trying to sync with the network as well as validate transactions. Briefly describe the concept of stateless client, and how they help resolve this issue? Explain how Zero-Knowledge improves on the concept of stateless client?

```
```


## Roll the TX up

3. ZKSync 2.0 was recently launched to testnet and has introduced ZKPorter. Argue for or against ZKPorter, highlighting the advantages or shortcomings in this new protocol.

```
What does zkPorter solve? Well, it allows for large scale network scalability on an exponential scale, and also allows for composability of applications and protocols.
```

## Recursive SNARK’s

1. Why would someone use recursive SNARK’s? What issues does it solve? Are there any security drawbacks?

```
```

2. What is Kimchi and how does it improve PLONK?

```
```

## Final Project Ideas

1. Describe 2-3 different, independent ideas for your final project. For each, describe the idea in about 150 words, explaining which aspect of ZK you are capitalizing on (privacy, succinctness, or fairness), and why this may be a timely product for the market. See the advice below for guidance and inspiration.

```
Project 0: AnonDeploy. In this zk privacy project, the developer can deploy a contract anonymously through a burner wallet and mixer. Privacy is important for DAO members, adn the DAOs deployer should also be able to be anonymous.
```
```
Project 1: MMORPG zero knowledge random drop system. In this system, the dungeon boss drops an item with a random VDF function calculating the probability, and then the winner of the item is also picked with a VDF. All of the raid are given an item with a mixer, winners of the best gear is kept secret with a zkp. 
Why is this cool? Well, no need for jealousy in guilds anymore. Everyone is equally ignorant. :).
```

2. Compare the pros and cons of the ideas, and try to make a strong case for each project. Describe some shortcomings including feasibility given the time frame and existence of competing products, as well as how you may be able to address these shortcomings.

```
Project 0 pros: can be made quickly and with a fork of tornado cash so the audit will be small and cheap. cons: it is not super innovative. Cons addressed by potentially creating an awesome frontend.
```
```
Project 1: pros: innovative and exciting! cons: large project with many aspects required to link into it, so large audit. Cons addressed by commmiting much time to the project.
```

## Thinking in ZK

1. If you have a chance to meet with the people who built ZKSync and Mina, what questions would you ask them about their protocols?

```
