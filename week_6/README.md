# Interoperability trilemma

1. Explain each aspect of the interoperability trilemma. Provide an example of a bridge protocol explaining which trade-offs on the trilemma the bridge makes.

```

```

```

```

# Ultra light clients

1. Describe a specification for a light client based on zero-knowledge proofs. You should explain at least how to get the client synced up to the current state of the blockchain. Preferably go as far as explain how transaction inclusion proofs are generated too.

```

```

2. What is the relevance of light clients for bridge applications? How does it affect relayers?

```

```

```

```

# Horizon Bridge

1. Check out [Horizon repository](https://github.com/harmony-one/horizon). 

a. Briefly explain how the bridge process works (mention all necessary steps: harmony light client, ethereum light client, token locker on harmony, token locker on ethereum, test contract). Provide commented code in your submission.

```

```

b. Why HarmonyLightClient has bytes32 mmrRoot field and EthereumLightClient does not? (You will need to think of blockchain architecture to answer this)

```

```
