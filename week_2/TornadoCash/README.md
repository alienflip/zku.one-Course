Tornado Nova pool will allow users to deposit & withdraw arbitrary amounts of ETH. Up to now, all Tornado Cash pools had one thing in common: users could only deposit and withdraw a fixed amount of a given token within each pool. Speed & cost being the cornerstone of user experience, Tornado Cash Nova uses the Gnosis Chain as a Layer2 (former xDAI). Thanks to this, users can benefit from cheaper fees, while still having fast transactions. Two transfer methods are available to provide ETH in order to pay the gas fee for a transaction. You can either connect your wallet or use a Relayer. Going through your wallet for this gas fee can compromise the anonymity of the transfer if used ETH is linkable to your identity. Therefore, it is recommended to use a Relayer to preserve privacy.
