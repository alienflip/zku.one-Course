### Privacy & ZK VMs

> question 1

1. A blockchains state transitions to a new state through a consensus mechanism. A list of transactions are proposed by a executing node, and then the validator nodes must come to consensus as to whether to write this `block` to the chain. 

2. A ZK-VM, at its core, is a trans-compiler, along with a program execution engine. In the wider blockchain community, people do not want to have to understand how to program circuits, or why they should, they just want to make their solidity contracts and iterate fast. A ZK-VM allows for this abstraction layer.
